description: An introduction to ZentinelJS

This is the default file structure of the Zentinel. It's a bit overwhelming but everything is straight forward once you get used to it.

```bash
ğŸ“¦ZentinelJS
 â”£ ğŸ“‚app
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚controllers # Contains the controllers handling application logic.
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚middlewares # Houses middleware functions for request processing.
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚models # Stores data models for interacting with the database.
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚routes # Defines API routes for different versions.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚v1 # Specifically, version 1 of the API routes.
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚services # Includes services for business logic implementation.
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚utilities # Provides utility functions used across the application.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚config # Holds configuration files for various environments and settings.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚database
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚migrations # Contains database migration scripts.
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“‚seeders # Houses data seeders for initial database population.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚public # Publicly accessible files such as front-end assets.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚storage
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚logs # Stores application logs for debugging and monitoring.
 â”£ ğŸ“‚tests # Contains test cases to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application.
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.env # Environment-specific configuration variables (not included in version control).
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.env.example # Example template for the .env file.
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.gitattributes
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ğŸ“œ.sequelizerc # Configuration file for Sequelize CLI.
 â”£ ğŸ“œbabel.config.json
 â”£ ğŸ“œbun.lockb
 â”£ ğŸ“œLICENSE
 â”£ ğŸ“œpackage-lock.json
 â”£ ğŸ“œpackage.json
 â”£ ğŸ“œpm2.config.js # Configuration file for PM2, a process manager for Node.js applications.
 â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
 â”£ ğŸ“œserver.js # Entry point script for starting the server.
 â”— ğŸ“œzentinel.config.json # Configuration specific to ZentinelJS.

Understanding the file structure of a boilerplate before beginning development is crucial for several reasons. 

First, it allows developers to quickly locate specific components like controllers, models, routes, and configurations, saving time and reducing frustration during the development process. 

Second, familiarity with the structure enables seamless integration of new features and modules, as developers can easily identify where new code should be added and how it interacts with existing functionalities. This understanding also fosters better collaboration within teams, as everyone can efficiently navigate the project's layout and work together more effectively. 

Knowing the file structure facilitates easier debugging and maintenance tasks. When issues arise, developers can swiftly trace problems back to their source, whether it's a configuration error, a bug in the codebase, or a compatibility issue between modules. Ultimately, a clear understanding of the file structure sets a solid foundation for efficient development, smoother teamwork, and more effective problem-solving throughout the lifecycle of the project.
