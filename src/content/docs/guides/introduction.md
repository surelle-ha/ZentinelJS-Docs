description: An introduction to ZentinelJS
---

Zentinel.JS is a boilerplate built on top of Express.JS, structured to mirror the Laravel directory format for a familiar setup. It includes Artisan-like commands called 'Zentinel' to streamline development tasks, offering a toolset for efficient backend operations and seamless integration. Zentinel doesn't come fully loaded out of the box like NestJS or Fastify. There's still plenty of room for users to customize and enhance it as needed. The goal of this project is simply to provide users with a solid starting point.

## NOT A FRAMEWORK

Zentinel is not, and will never be, classified as a framework. The primary objective of Zentinel is to provide a significant head start to developers who prefer working with ExpressJS. It aims to streamline the development process by eliminating the need to build projects from the ground up. By offering pre-configured setups and essential tools, Zentinel empowers developers to jump straight into building their applications, thereby saving time and effort. This approach ensures that developers can maintain their focus on writing code and implementing features rather than dealing with the initial setup and configuration of their projects. 

## Philosophy
As a Software Engineer who loves working with ExpressJS, I got tired of the repetitive process of setting up projects from scratch every time. To solve this, I decided to create a boilerplate that gives developers a head start. This boilerplate isn't just a basic template; it's a carefully designed starting point with essential configurations, pre-built modules, and best practices included. The idea is to save developers time and effort, so they can focus on building their applications without getting bogged down by the initial setup. This way, we can jump straight into coding and creating, making the whole process more efficient and enjoyable.
